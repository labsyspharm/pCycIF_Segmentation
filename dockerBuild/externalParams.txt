%   Nececsarry input variables for segmentation
%   inputPath: absolute path to the location of image stacks to segment. 
%       Reguired format: string, example: '/path/to/files/'
%   outputPath: absolute path to the location to save segmented images (if desired) and spreadsheets
%       Reguired format: string, example: '/path/to/files/'
%   numCycles: number of cycles in CycIF experiment
%       Reguired format: double, example: 5
%   row: rows on a 96-well plate to segment
%       Reguired format: character array, ['FirstRow' : 'LastRow'] example: ['B':'H']
%   col: colu,ns on a 96-well plate to segment
%       Reguired format: double array, [FirstCol : LastCol] example: [2:11]
%   SaveFig: option to save image stack with new segmentation mask
%       Requried format: 0 or 1. 1 saves mask, 0 does not.
